## First version (most of the front-end) was commited at 20.1.2023 and this is what i learned and did to this point:
- Using OOP and constructors for book storage (will change this when I learn back end, but it did help me with practicing js);
- How to make tables with CSS and display: table;
- Improved HTML and CSS writing and also transitions;
- **Felt a lot more confident about writing the code and found myself finding solutions faster then before!**
